## Documentation

- **Code Documentation:** Use JSDoc or TypeScript interfaces to document components, hooks, and complex logic. This helps other developers understand the code's purpose and usage.
- **Project README:** Maintain an up-to-date README with:
  - Setup instructions (e.g., installation, environment setup).
  - Project structure overview.
  - Common commands (e.g., `expo start`, `expo build`).
  - Links to relevant documentation (e.g., Expo, React Native).
