## Additional Best Practices

- **Threading Model Awareness:** Understand React Native's threading model and offload heavy computations to background threads using libraries like [react-native-workers](https://github.com/devfd/react-native-workers) or `InteractionManager` to keep the UI responsive.
- **Use Expo Tools:** Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates to streamline the release process.
- **Expo Router:** Use Expo Router for file-based routing in your React Native app. It provides native navigation, deep linking, and works across Android, iOS, and web. Refer to the official documentation for setup and usage: [Expo Router Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).
