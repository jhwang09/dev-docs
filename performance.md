## React Native Performance Optimization

- **Optimize State Management:** Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed to reduce re-renders.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo()` for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Consider `useMemo` and `useCallback` for optimizing expensive calculations and function references.

- **FlatList Optimization:** Optimize `FlatList` with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize` to improve scrolling performance on large lists.
- **Avoid Anonymous Functions:** Refrain from using anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Performance Profiling:** Use [React DevTools](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools) to profile and optimize component renders, identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks.
