## JavaScript Usage

- **Avoid Global Variables:** Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects and maintain clean code.
- **Use ES6+ Features:** Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise and modern JavaScript code.
- **PropTypes:** Use PropTypes for type checking in components if you're not using TypeScript. However, consider switching to TypeScript for better type safety (see the [TypeScript Usage](#typescript-usage) section below).
