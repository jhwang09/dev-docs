## Testing

- **Write Tests:** Ensure the reliability of the codebase by writing tests for components, hooks, and business logic.
  - **Unit Tests:** Use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing individual components and functions.
  - **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components and state management.
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Use [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox) for testing the app's user flows on real devices.
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths and reusable components, to facilitate refactoring and prevent regressions.
