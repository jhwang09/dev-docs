## State Management

- **Choose the Right Tool:** Depending on the complexity of the app, select an appropriate state management solution.
  - **Simple Apps:** Use the [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) with `useReducer` for managing global state.
  - **Complex Apps:** Consider [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) for more advanced state management needs.
- **Optimize State Updates:** Avoid unnecessary re-renders by using memoization techniques and keeping state as local as possible. Use tools like `useSelector` (Redux) or `observer` (MobX) to optimize performance.
