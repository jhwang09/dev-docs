## Code Style and Structure

- **Write Clean, Readable Code:** Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- **Use Functional Components:** Prefer functional components with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) over class components for simplicity and better performance.
- **Component Modularity:** Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility to improve reusability and testability.
- **Organize Files by Feature:** Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`) to maintain a clear and scalable project structure.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables and Functions:** Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
- **Components:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- **Directories:** Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories and file names (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`) to ensure consistency across the project.
