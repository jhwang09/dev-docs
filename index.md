# Development Documentation üßë‚Äçüíª

This document outlines the best practices for developing a React (and React Native) application. These guidelines are designed to ensure the project is maintainable, scalable, and efficient. By following these practices, developers can create high-quality code that is easy to understand, test, and extend.

## TypeScript Usage (Preferred)

- **Use TypeScript:** Leverage TypeScript for type safety, which helps catch errors early and improves code readability. Define types for **props**, **state**, and **API responses** to make the code more self-documenting and easier to maintain.
- **Expo:** Refer to the [Expo TypeScript guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/) for setup instructions and best practices. TypeScript is especially beneficial for larger teams and long-term projects.

## UI and Styling

- **Consistent Styling:** Use `StyleSheet.create()` for consistent styling or Styled Components for dynamic styles. Ensure styles are modular and reusable.
- **Optimize Image Handling:** Use optimized image libraries like `react-native-fast-image` to handle images efficiently, reducing memory usage and improving load times.
- **Design System:** Use a design system or UI library like [gluestack-ui](https://gluestack.io/) to maintain consistency in the app's look and feel across components.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Use responsive units (e.g., percentages, `Dimensions` API) or libraries like `react-native-responsive-screen`.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the app is accessible by following best practices such as proper color contrast, touch target sizes, and screen reader support. Refer to the [React Native Accessibility guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility).
