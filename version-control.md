## Version Control

- **Branching Strategy:** Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes. Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/login-crash`).
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use the format: `[Type] Description` (e.g., `[Feat] Add login screen`, `[Fix] Resolve crash on logout`).
- **Code Reviews:** Require code reviews before merging pull requests to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing. Use GitHub's pull request features for discussions and approvals.
