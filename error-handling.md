## Error Handling and Logging

- **Global Error Handling:** Implement a global error boundary to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully. Use libraries like [react-native-error-boundary](https://github.com/aidanlobato/react-native-error-boundary) for this purpose.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Use logging libraries like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/react-native/) or [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/for/react-native) to track errors, performance issues, and user interactions in production. This helps in debugging and improving the app over time.
